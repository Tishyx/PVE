# Rogue PvE Damage Dummy Simulator

This project simulates a Rogue combat rotation directly in the browser.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Build the TypeScript source into browser-ready JavaScript:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in a browser. The page loads the compiled script from `dist/index.js`.

## Development Notes

- Source files live in `index.ts` and `style.css`.
- Compiled assets are emitted to `dist/` by the TypeScript compiler.
